# vsCode Explorer UI

I created the vscode-explorer-ui project in React to familiarize myself with rendering files infinitely with proper indentation. My goal was to learn how to manage files by adding, removing, renaming them, and nesting folders. It turned out to be an enjoyable task, so I decided to enhance the project to resemble a VSCode UI!

### Features

- **File and Folder Management:** Easily add, remove, and rename files and folders. You can create nested structures as well!
- **Infinite Rendering:** Files are rendered infinitely with correct indentation for easy navigation.
- **Tab Functionality:** Open multiple files in tabs, allowing for effortless switching between them.
- **File Data Display:** View file details directly in the UI.

Feel free to contribute additional features, such as a terminal UI or a code editor (either from scratch or using a library). Just ensure that your contributions match the overall theme!
